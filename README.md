# PyBer_Analysis

This analysis for a hypothetical rideshare company is meant to break down the number of rides, number of drivers, total fares, and average fares by city type (urban, suburban, and rural). This will inform business decisions made for each type of city.

## Results

As you can see from the above images, urban cities have by far the highest number of drivers, rides, and total fares, followed by suburban cities an drural cities. However, average fares per ride and average fares per driver are highest in rural areas, followed by suburban cities, then urban ones.

## Summary

- Pyber should invest heavily in increasing number of drivers/ridership in urban cities. Even though the average fares are lowest (most likely due to density- people don't need to drive as far in urban areas), the higher population (especially the number of people who don't own their own cars) means that revenue will liekly still be higher in these areas.

- Pyber should consider raising rates in urban areas given high the number of rides and low average fare relative to other city types.

- There were not strong trends for ride volume in specific months. There may not be a need for changes thoughout the year.
